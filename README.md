# R Functions

Collection of all of custom R functions. Primarily for use in genomics and experimental analysis + some visualization tools. 

## Quick Start

Load all functions at once:
```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsayle-research/r-functions/main/R/load-all-functions.R") 
```
New functions are loaded into the **r.functions/R** directory and added to the **load-all-functions.R** master file.

If there ever becomes too many functions to load all at once - I will consider separating them by category - for now it is okay.
