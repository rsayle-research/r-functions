# R Functions

Collection of all custom R functions. Primarily for use in genomics and experimental analysis + some visualization tools. 

## Quick Start

Load all functions at once:
```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsayle-research/r-functions/main/R/load-all-functions.R") 

#New functions are loaded into the r.functions/R directory and added to the load-all-functions.R
